<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO DAMLA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies heheh</h2><hr />
<h3>In The Mood For Love</h3>
<p>It's my favorite since the first moment I saw it. I love the shoots, the color and the vibe so much.</p>
<h3>Love, Spells and All That</h3>
<p>Best quir movie for me. I felt that love isn't that far and hard to reach. Even the time and distance cant be in road of two people loving each other.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I loved the animation to much that I would watch it even if it didnt have a plot. </p>
